# How To Use Compiled Program
CDSProject does not make use of a main server. All that's needed is a MySQL 
database with 2 tables. 1 for the users, and 1 for the application database.

No importable .SQL is supplied. You'll have to read the code and create the database
and tables manually.

# Compiling
No special pre-requisites should be needed. Just open the project file and compile
